					<h2>Introduction</h2>				
					<img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="Brandon Cruz" class="image" />						
					<p>Hello, my name is Brandon Cruz and I am a System Administrator at Cornell University.</p><p>My story starts as a summer intern at BorgWarner
					Inc, working in the IT dept. I had no idea other than how to use a PC before I started and I was surprised to how much I had to learn! So for the 
					next few summers, I shadowed everyone I could within the IT field from the Help Desk Admins, to the Programmers, to the Client Techs, and finally to the
					Server/Network Admins. I realized that in order to grow in this field, I had to pick a path and learn as much as possible and keep learning! I was hired in 2007
					as a Client Tech from BorgWarner and spent the next 8 years learning new technologies and picking up certifications along the way.</p><p> As of recently in 2012, I 
					have made a decision to further my career by enrolling at Western Governors University with an emphasis 
					in <em class="bold">Network Administration</em>. It was through my previous work experience at BorgWarner that 
					solidified my decision to pursue a new direction and career change. My interest in the Network Administration industry 
					grew as I performed Networking, Server Administration, Testing and Troubleshooting skills on Server equipment and 
					Manufacturing Systems. </p>
